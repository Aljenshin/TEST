    <b>Rabbits are small mammals</b> in the family Leporidae 
(which also includes the hares), which is in the order Lagomorpha 
(which also includes pikas). The European rabbit, 
Oryctolagus cuniculus, is the ancestor of the world's 
hundreds of breeds[1] of domestic rabbit and has been introduced 
on every continent except Antarctica. It is familiar throughout the 
world as a wild prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock, and a 
pet, having a widespread effect on ecologies and cultures. Sylvilagus 
includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the 
seven types of cottontail. <b><i>Wild rabbits not included in 
Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus include several species of limited 
distribution, including the pygmy rabbit, volcano rabbit, 
and Sumatran striped rabbit.</i></b>

 <p>
        <b><i>Rabbits are a paraphyletic grouping</i></b>, and do not constitute a clade,
    as hares (belonging to the genus Lepus) are nested within the 
    Leporidae clade and are not included in rabbits. <b><i>Although once 
    considered rodents</i></b>, lagomorphs diverged earlier and have a number 
    of traits rodents lack, including two extra incisors. Similarities 
    between rabbits and rodents were once attributed to convergent 
    evolution, but studies in molecular biology have found a common 
    ancestor between lagomorphs and rodents and place them in the clade
    Glires.
